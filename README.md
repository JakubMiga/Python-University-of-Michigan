# Beginner level Python course - "Getting Started with Python" Charles Severance University of Michigan

This course is designed to teach everyone the basics of computer programming using Python. The basics of constructing a program from a series of simple instructions in Python are discussed. The course has no prerequisites and avoids all but the simplest math. Any person with moderate computer experience should be able to master the material in this course. The course covers chapters 1-5 of the "Python for Everyone" textbook. Once a student completes this course, he or she will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3.

What I learned from the course:

Describe the basics of the Python programming language
Use variables to store, retrieve and calculate information
Use basic programming tools such as functions and loops
Progressing through the course, the level of difficulty increased from Task 1-2 and from Test 1-7 The program on which I wrote code: Visual Studio Code
